# R3-Rogue-Robot-on-Rampage
A VR Game built using Unity3D and Blender.

## StoryLine
The story starts in a futuristic setting with the main character, the Engineer, building a giant robot. Unsatisfied with the mechanical nature of the robot, the Engineer builds an artificial heart for his creation. 

The heart proves to be too powerful for the Robot. It wreaks havoc in its attempt to control its emotions. The Engineer, the protector of his people, slashes the Robotâ€™s chest apart with his sword and removes the heart. Unable to destroy the powerful artifact, he flees to hide it, never again to be discovered. The Robot, enraged at losing its heart, sets off in its search, destroying everything along the way. 

Devastated, the Engineer lures it to the abandoned land where he created the Robot, and attempts to kill it before it finds its heart.
